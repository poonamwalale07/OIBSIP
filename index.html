      <ul class="py-4">
        <li>1) Rajput's personal relationships have been the subject of widespread media attention. In 2011, Rajput publicly proposed to his <i>Pavitra Rishta</i> co-star Ankita Lokhande during a national broadcast of the dance competition show <i>Jhalak Dikhhla Jaa</i>; both of them had participated in the show as competing contestants. The couple began dating after their first meeting on the set of Pavitra Rishta, where they had been cast as husband and wife to each other.</li>
        <li>2) In 2014, rumours that they were already secretly married due to family pressure were denied by the couple. In January 2016, Rajput confirmed that a lavish wedding would take place in December, but the relationship ended prior to that, with the pair maintaining silence on the reasons for the cancellation. In a 2021 interview, Lokhande said that Rajput wanted to go ahead in his career and they ended their relationship mutually.</li>
        <li>3) In 2018, he was the subject of another rumour regarding his Kedarnath co-star Sara Ali Khan. The rumours were never confirmed, as, before the two supposedly broke up, Rajput refused to comment on the claims. Later in the next year, it was reported that he was dating actress Rhea Chakraborty and that they intended to keep the matter private.</li>

        <li>On 14 June 2020, Rajput, aged 34, was found dead in his home in Bandra, Mumbai. He had reportedly shown signs of clinical depression and had bipolar disorder.
